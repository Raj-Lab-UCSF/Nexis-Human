# Nexis-Human

Nexis set up to fit to individual human data (gene or global)

1. Go to 'Nexis human.ipynb'
2. Select initial vector method (start with binary)
3. Upload gene data and select gene of interest
4. Run parameter optimization and then Nexis on an individual subject to check that the model is working
5. Total tau plot gives a sense of how well the model is fitting to the individuals data
6. Loop through all patients
